# ML-UK-RoadAccidents
The business objective is to help improving road safety in the UK, by developing a predictive model that is able to predict accident severity based on various external variables. We would be a government agency trying to find out where to deploy resources for in order to enhance road safety.

We will use data from the UK Government website: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data

The website provides datasets regarding road safety in the UK, and we are going to use the containing data about accidents occured in 2019 given some external and internal factors. Due to the business objective and the context we have supposed to play in, we will only be using external factors data. Lastly, 2019 data are the latest available at this time.
